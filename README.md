# Application of Deep Learning-Based EEG Signal Analysis in Athlete Fatigue Monitoring 🧠🏃‍♂️

This project presents a deep learning framework for athlete fatigue monitoring using EEG signals. By leveraging a **Fatigue-Aware Multi-Modal Network (FAMNet)** and an **Adaptive Fatigue Management Strategy (AFMS)**, we aim to provide accurate, interpretable, and real-time fatigue assessment to optimize athletic performance and reduce injury risk.

## 📝 Abstract

Monitoring athlete fatigue is essential for optimizing performance and preventing injuries, yet current methods struggle with inter-individual variability, multimodal data integration, and temporal dynamics. 

This study introduces:
- **FAMNet**: A neural architecture integrating multi-modal inputs via modality-specific encoders, temporal modeling with dilated convolutions, and attention mechanisms to capture complex fatigue patterns.
- **AFMS**: A strategy that enhances prediction by calibrating models to individual profiles, incorporating real-time feedback, and enforcing domain-specific constraints.

Our experiments demonstrate superior performance in accuracy, adaptability, and interpretability, highlighting this framework’s potential to revolutionize fatigue monitoring and management in sports science.
